        <h2>Advanced Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <p>
          There are countless tips and tricks that can be done as Brewmaster to
          help you and your group. I will go over some of the more common tips
          and tricks that benefit you and your team. Some of these examples are
          from past seasons, but they still serve as excellent examples of what
          you can do.

        <h2>When to Kite</h2>
        <p>
          When should I be kiting? This is an essential question. In short, it's
          a question of, “Do I have defensive cooldowns available to facetank
          the pull?” If the answer is no, then you kite. If the answer is yes,
          then you have to assess whether you're saving any special cooldowns
          for the next pull. If the answer is no, then you kite when you've
          exhausted all other options (except the one cooldown you're saving).
        </p>

          staying out of range so my DPS can AoE efficiently.

        <h2>How to use your Toolkit to Kite</h2>
        <p>
          Brewmasters have one of the best toolkits in the game when it comes to
          locking down mobs and kiting with
          <a
            href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116844/ring-of-peace"

            >Transcendence</a
          >. To successfully use this toolkit to kite, let's look at a couple of
          clips. Also, a small but important tip is to use
          <a

            >Vivify</a
          >
          while you're kiting. Not only does it heal you, but it also generates
          threat at the same time.

            target="_blank"
            class="orange"
            >Leg Sweep</a
          >. After that, I just kite until
          <a

          >
          is back up, then tank them once again. This clip is a good showcase of
          something that you can do. It is an important skill to know how long
          you need to kite and how long you can survive until you need to kite.
        </p>
        <p>
          For an example on how to use
          <a
            href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=101643/transcendence"

          >
          to drop stacks of a debuff and minimize incoming damage, I'll use this
          clip from The Necrotic Wake. You'll see here that I'm getting blasted
          by melee swings due to having three stacks of the Tenderize debuff
          from the Goregrind (since each stack is a physical damage increase of
          12%). I start walking away partway through the pull (at about 00:16),
          drop a
          <a
            href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=101643/transcendence"
            target="_blank"
            class="orange"
            >Transcendence</a
          >
          spirit, and I create some extra distance with a quick
          <a
            href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=109132/roll"
            target="_blank"
            class="orange"
            >Roll</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=116841/tigers-lust"
            target="_blank"
            class="orange"
            >Tiger's Lust</a
          >. I wait for the Goregrind to Gutslice, let him walk a little closer
          to me, and then port back to my spirit just before the next Tenderize.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best place to use tricks like this is in Halls of Valor, where you
          have debuffs to drop but you don't want the mobs running all over the
          place, or when you're just kiting bears or wolves. You will see this
          in action in the next section.

          is basically a heal for 12.5% of your current stagger when you purify.
          The easiest way to explain maximizing this is that high stagger equals
          good; you want to sit on high stagger until you need a heal, then you
          purify once to top yourself, let your stagger build again, then purify
          again to top yourself. If you're doing a big pull, like in Waycrest
          Manor or Blackrook Hold, you want to use stuff like
          <a

          and defensive trinkets to let your stagger build. Once those fall off,
          you rotate

        <h2>Forcing a Dodge</h2>
        <p>
          Another great bonus trick is forcing a dodge on tank busters. You do
          this by turning your back to the boss or mob, doing dps in between
          auto attacks to build up
          <a

            >Elusive Brawler</a
          >
          stacks, and then facing the mob during the ability you are trying to
          dodge is being cast. Here's a clip of this in real time. The logic
          here is to build up your stacks of
          <a
            href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=117906/mastery-elusive-brawler"

          >
          to virtually guarantee that you dodge the Hateful Charge. You pretty
          much guarantee that you will dodge this attack if you ensure that you
          do not dodge the boss's autoattack that he uses right before Hateful
          Charge. This type of force dodge technique takes a lot of practice to
          time correctly, but it helps your healer out substantially once you
          get the hang of it.
